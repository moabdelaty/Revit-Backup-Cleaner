## **Welcome to the Revit Backup Cleaner Tool**
This tool is designed to help you automate the cleaning of Revit backup files, freeing up space and keeping your directories organized. Whether you're working on projects or families, this tool ensures that unnecessary backups are removed efficiently.

---

## **Features**

- **Dry Run Mode**: Simulate the cleaning process without deleting files, ensuring no accidental removals.
- **Deep Cleaning**: Recursively clean all subdirectories to ensure no backups are left behind.
- **Custom Folder Input**: Specify folder paths via a `.txt` file for flexibility.
- **Interactive User Prompts**: Confirm your choices with simple yes/no inputs.
- **Detailed Notifications**: Receive summaries of the cleaning process via desktop notifications (Windows-only).
- **Space Recovery Report**: Know exactly how much storage was freed.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Input Folder Paths**: Provide a `.txt` file containing the paths to directories you want to clean.
2. **Choose Preferences**:
   - Dry Run mode to preview deletions.
   - Deep Cleaning to include subdirectories.
3. **Run the Cleaner**: The tool scans the specified directories and deletes backup files with extensions `.????.rvt` and `.????.rfa`.
4. **Get Notifications**: Receive a summary of the cleaning process, including the number of files deleted and storage space recovered.
